This notebook analyzes customer churn behavior using a dataset that includes demographic, geographic, and financial information such as age, country, balance, estimated salary, and activity status.
The goal is to explore which features most strongly predict churn and to evaluate multiple models (Random Forest and XGBoost) for churn prediction.

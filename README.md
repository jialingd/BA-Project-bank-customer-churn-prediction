# Customer Churn Prediction Analysis

## Overview
This notebook analyzes customer churn behavior using demographic, geographic, and financial data to identify key drivers of churn and build predictive models for churn classification.

## Dataset Features
The analysis utilizes comprehensive customer information including:
- **Demographic**: Age, gender
- **Geographic**: Country
- **Financial**: Balance, estimated salary
- **Activity**: Activity status, engagement metrics

## Objectives
1. **Exploratory Analysis**: Identify which features most strongly correlate with customer churn
2. **Feature Importance**: Determine the key drivers that predict churn behavior
3. **Predictive Modeling**: Build and evaluate classification models for churn prediction

## Models Implemented
- **Random Forest** - Ensemble method using multiple decision trees
- **XGBoost** - Gradient boosting implementation optimized for performance

## Key Analyses
- Feature importance ranking and visualization
- Model performance comparison (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score)
- Insights into customer segments most likely to churn
- Recommendations for churn prevention strategies

## Business Value
This analysis helps identify at-risk customers and understand the underlying factors driving churn, enabling targeted retention strategies and proactive customer relationship management.
